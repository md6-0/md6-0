### Hi there, I’m Mario 👨👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working in Altia as an OutSystems certified developer.
- ❤️ I’m in love with HTML and CSS. I also like all things web development and web desing related.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about OutSystems platform. But I’m always learning about CSS good practices, trends and new features.
- ⚡ Fun fact: As a trainee in a web development company I found my love for CSS. When I was a student I kinda hated CSS, but after working intensely with it for a couple of months I found myself making little proyects and reading articles to improve my CSS skills and knowledge. During my stay as a trainee, I also learned about SASS/SCSS and how helpfull and powerfull it is.
