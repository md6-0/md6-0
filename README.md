### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working in Altia as an OutSystems certified developer.
- ❤️ I love working with CSS and creating little proyects where I challenge myself to use all my CSS skills.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about the OutSystems Low Code platform. But I’m always learning about CSS good practices, trends and new features.
- ⚡ Fun fact: As a trainee in a web development company I found my love for CSS. When I was a student I kinda hate CSS, but after working intensely with it for a couple of months, I found myself making little proyects and reading articles to improve my CSS skills and knowledge. During my stay as a trainee, I also learned about SASS/SCSS and how helpfull and powerfull it is.
